# Assessment for Application Support Developer Role

You are given reports of intermittent performance issues from a customer's website. Your task is to analyze simulated logs, debug a script, query a database, and propose a solutionâ€”all while demonstrating your ability to monitor, script, and problem-solve effectively.

## Provided Materials

1.  `nginx_access.log`: A sample log file with 7200 entries.
2.  `python_monitor.py`: A partially broken Python script meant to analyze logs.
3.  `traffic.db`: A SQLite database file with a table `request_logs` containing fields: `timestamp`, `ip_address`, `status_code`, `response_time_ms`, `bytes_sent`.
4.  Instructions: This document with tasks and deliverables.

These can be accessed from our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/SuyunCDN/L2-assessment).

## Tasks

### 1. Nginx Log Analysis

Analyze the provided `nginx_access.log` file (Go through some initial logs to understand the pattern). Write a Python script to:

* Identify the top 5 IP addresses by request count.
* Calculate the percentage of requests with status codes in the 400-599 range.
* Find the average response size in bytes for GET requests.

> [!NOTE]
> The script should generate a readable output (console or text file).

### 2. Debugging the Python Script

The provided `python_monitor.py` script is meant to monitor a log file and alert if error rates exceed 10% in a 5-minute window. However, it contains intentional bugs. Your task is to:

* Fix the script and ensure it works correctly.
* Write a short explanation describing the bugs you identified and how you fixed them.

### 3. Attack Pattern Detection

Write a Bash or Python script to detect potential attack patterns in the logs. Your script should analyze the logs and flag suspicious IPs or behaviors.

> [!TIP]
> Consider looking for specific patterns in abnormal requests.

Output: The script should generate a summary of potential attack patterns, including flagged IPs, abnormal request frequencies, with the detected anomalies.

### 4. SQL Querying (Database Analysis)

Using the provided `traffic.db` SQLite database, write SQL queries to:

* Find the hour of the day with the highest average response time.
* Identify any IPs that sent more than 350 requests with a 429 status code (rate-limited).
* Calculate the total bytes sent for requests where response time > 500ms.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Submit both the SQL queries and their results.

### 5. (Bonus) CDN Performance Optimization

Based on your findings in Tasks 1-3, suggest one mitigation step to improve CDN performance for this customer. Keep it concise (2-3 sentences).

## Deliverables

Candidates must submit:

* All scripts (`.py`, `.sh`, `.sql` files).
* A `results.txt` file containing:
    * Output from Task 1 (Top IPs, error percentage, avg response size).
    * Output from Task 3 (Potential attacking IPs).
    * Output from Task 4 (SQL query results).
    * Any additional observations.
* A short write-up (1-2 pages) covering:
    * Bug fixes for Task 2.
    * Explanation of attack detection script (Task 3).
    * Optional CDN optimization recommendation (Task 5).

  To submit this assessment, create a fork of the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/SuyunCDN/L2-assessment) and issue a Pull Request with your solutions, under a dedicated folder of your full name (hiphenized). Additionally, send an email reply to your assessment notifying about the completion, along with the link to the Pull Request.

> [!CAUTION]
> Ensure all deliverables are submitted within the specified time frame communicated over email.
